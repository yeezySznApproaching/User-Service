# User Service

## Overview

The User Service handles user-related operations such as registration, authentication, and profile management for the Hotel Management System.

## Setup

In order to run it, make sure to create a dotenv file where you should store your mongodb URI connection string, and initialize the PORT to PORT=3001.
